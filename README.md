# Medium RTL Support Chrome Plugin
A Chrome plugin that corrects how `medium.com` displays RTL languages like Arabic and Osmanli Turkish. Initially I needed a fix for my personal blog `muktar.tech` so I wrote this.

# How to install?
1. Clone the repo, or Download it as zip file if you're not familiar with git.
2. Follow the steps explained on [the official Chrome docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
